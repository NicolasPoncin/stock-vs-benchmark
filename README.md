# üìä Quantitative Stock Analysis ‚Äî JPM vs SPY

## Overview

This project is a **personal learning initiative** focused on quantitative analysis of a financial asset (JPMorgan Chase & Co.) compared to a benchmark (S&P 500 ETF - SPY). It combines financial theory with Python implementation to explore performance, risk, and statistical properties of asset returns.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **not investment advice**.

## Goals

- Analyze historical performance and risk metrics
- Visualize return distributions, drawdowns, and tracking error
- Apply financial models such as Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar ratios, CAPM, VaR, and CVaR
- Experiment with time series forecasting (ARIMA) for educational purposes

## Current Version

This **version 1** is focused specifically on **JPM** and **SPY**.  
It provides a full pipeline of analysis comparing these two assets across multiple dimensions.

## What's Next

The upcoming **version 2** will be fully **dynamic and customizable**:
- Users will be able to **select any stock and benchmark tickers**
- The entire analysis will run **automatically** based on those inputs
- The framework will be modular and reusable for broader asset comparisons

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `scipy`, `yfinance`
